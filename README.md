# Whispers of the Web 👻

A haunted AI-powered radio that generates eerie ghost broadcasts on demand.

## 🧠 Idea

What if ghost stories were real-time transmissions from the other side?
Each “station” plays unique AI-generated audio: whispers, ghost tales, or coded messages.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **AI:** OpenAI GPT-3.5
- **Audio:** gTTS (Text-to-Speech)
- **Hosting:** Replit / Render

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User tunes into a channel.
2. Flask requests AI to generate a themed message.
3. Message is converted to ghostly audio and streamed back.

## 💡 Inspiration

Old shortwave radios that used to pick up mysterious “number stations” inspired this project.
